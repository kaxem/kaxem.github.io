Everything started with a pornographic website. I was 21 years old and somehow I had this idea about, how can I access to all of the website's videos. so I started to learn hack methods =)). in the half way, I learned about XSS and find a vulnerability in a site and reported it. they paid me a bug bounty$_$. Immediately I Purchased a premium account on that porn site. after all, I'm a junior DevOps Engineer who's interested in finding humanity bugs and debugging them.
