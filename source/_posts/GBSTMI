title: God's bash script to make Iranians
---
this is 1 line script i found in the "Moses: gnu-linux for judaism" book:
`touch Irani | echo 'misfortune=100' > Irani | time sleep 10 | mv -f Irani /dev/null`
that's it guys!
I tried to make an irani with it but it didn't worked. even not as SuperUser. darn it...!
